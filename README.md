# ðŸ’¡ Introduction to Observability
- Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a system by analyzing the data it produces, including logs, metrics, and traces.

- Monitoring(Metrics): involves tracking system metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, and network performance. Provides alerts based on predefined thresholds and conditions
    - `Monitoring tells us what is happening.`
- Logging(Logs):  involves the collection of log data from various components of a system.
    - `Logging explains why it is happening.`
- Tracing(Traces): involves tracking the flow of a request or transaction as it moves through different services and components within a system.
    - `Tracing shows how it is happening.`
