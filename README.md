# Observability in DevOps — End-to-End Hands-On Guide

A comprehensive, step-by-step guide to implementing observability in Kubernetes environments using industry-standard open-source tools.

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to set up complete observability infrastructure in Kubernetes by implementing the three pillars of observability: **metrics**, **logs**, and **traces**.

### Tools Covered

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Prometheus** | Metrics collection and storage |
| **Grafana** | Visualization and dashboards |
| **EFK Stack** | Centralized logging (Elasticsearch, Fluent Bit, Kibana) |
| **Jaeger** | Distributed tracing |

### Environment

While these demos use **Minikube** for local development, the same principles and configurations apply to production-grade clusters including:

- AWS EKS
- Google GKE
- Azure AKS

## Why Observability?

### The Challenge

In monolithic applications, debugging was straightforward—logs and metrics existed in a single location. Modern microservices architectures present a fundamentally different challenge:

- A single user request may traverse dozens of services
- Multiple programming languages and databases are involved
- Dependencies are distributed across infrastructure

**Traditional monitoring metrics (CPU, memory, uptime) are no longer sufficient.**

### The Three Pillars

Observability extends monitoring through three complementary data sources:

| Pillar | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Metrics** | Numerical data over time | Latency, request count, error rate |
| **Logs** | Text records of events | Errors, warnings, business events |
| **Traces** | Request path across services | Service call chain, latency breakdown |

### Key Questions Answered

- **Is my system healthy?** (Metrics)
- **What went wrong?** (Logs)
- **Where exactly did it fail?** (Traces)

## Core Tools

### 1. Prometheus — Metrics Collection

#### What It Is

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system designed for collecting, storing, and querying time-series metrics—numerical data that changes over time.

#### How It Works

**Collection Process:**

1. Prometheus **scrapes** metrics from applications and Kubernetes components at regular intervals
2. Applications expose a `/metrics` endpoint in Prometheus text format
3. Data is stored in a time-series database (TSDB)
4. Metrics are queried using PromQL (Prometheus Query Language)

#### Example

**Exposed Metric:**

```
http_requests_total{service="cart-service"}  245
```

**PromQL Query:**

```promql
rate(http_requests_total[5m])
```

*Returns: requests per second over the last 5 minutes*

#### Key Benefits

- Detect performance issues (latency spikes, error rate increases)
- Track infrastructure health (CPU, memory, pod restarts)
- Provide data source for Grafana visualizations

### 2. Grafana — Visualization & Dashboards

#### What It Is

Grafana is a visualization and analytics platform that connects to multiple data sources. It does not store data—instead, it queries and visualizes data from sources like Prometheus, Loki, Elasticsearch, and InfluxDB.

#### How It Works

**Visualization Process:**

1. Grafana queries configured data sources (e.g., Prometheus)
2. Data is rendered in customizable dashboards with charts and graphs
3. Multiple data sources can be combined in a single dashboard
4. Alert rules trigger notifications via email, Slack, or PagerDuty

#### Example Dashboard

A typical dashboard might display:

- CPU usage (from Prometheus)
- Error log counts (from Elasticsearch)
- Latency distribution (from Jaeger traces)

#### Key Benefits

- Unified monitoring interface for development and operations teams
- Transform raw data into actionable insights
- Flexible alerting and notification system

#### Integration Pattern

```
Prometheus (collects) → Grafana (visualizes) → Alertmanager (notifies)
```

### 3. EFK Stack — Centralized Logging

Logs provide the contextual details that explain metric anomalies.

**EFK = Elasticsearch + Fluent Bit + Kibana**

#### Component A: Fluent Bit — Log Collector

**Functionality:**

- Deployed as a DaemonSet on every Kubernetes node
- Reads pod logs from `/var/log/containers/`
- Forwards logs to Elasticsearch
- Optimized for performance and low resource usage

#### Component B: Elasticsearch — Log Storage & Search

**Functionality:**

- Search engine and database for log data
- Indexes logs for fast querying by time, keyword, pod, namespace, etc.
- Horizontally scalable for high-volume environments

#### Component C: Kibana — Visualization & Analysis

**Functionality:**

- Web interface for Elasticsearch
- Advanced search with filters (e.g., `error AND namespace=frontend`)
- Dashboard creation for log trend analysis

#### Example Workflow

```
1. Pod logs: ERROR: DB connection timeout
2. Fluent Bit forwards to Elasticsearch
3. Elasticsearch indexes with metadata (timestamp, pod, namespace)
4. Kibana query: "Show all errors in payment-service from the last hour"
```

#### Key Benefits

**Complementary Insights:**

- Metrics indicate **"something is wrong"**
- Logs reveal **"what exactly went wrong"**

### 4. Jaeger — Distributed Tracing

#### What It Is

Jaeger is a distributed tracing system originally developed by Uber. It visualizes the complete path of a request as it flows through microservices.

#### How It Works

**Tracing Process:**

1. Each request receives a unique **trace ID**
2. As the request traverses services, each service creates a **span** (unit of work)
3. Jaeger collects all spans and constructs a complete trace timeline

#### Example Trace

**Request Flow:**

```
User places order → API Gateway → Cart Service → Payment Service → Database
```

**Timing Breakdown:**

```
API Gateway:     10ms
Cart Service:    15ms
Payment Service: 2000ms  ← Performance bottleneck identified
Database:        20ms
```

Jaeger's UI displays a waterfall chart showing exactly where latency occurred.

#### Key Benefits

- Identify slow or failing microservices
- Debug distributed system failures
- Optimize end-to-end system performance

#### Best Practice

Use **OpenTelemetry SDKs** in your applications to export traces to Jaeger for standardized instrumentation.
